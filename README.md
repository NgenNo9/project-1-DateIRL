This website was created to give singletons an outlet to connect with people in the real world. Without relying on dating apps.

## User Story

Joe is an ordinary guy. He has been split with his ex for 2 years now. And in the last year alone, he has been on 43 first dates. He has had 4 second dates and only 1 third date. But he has never made a lasting connection. Joe puts this down to the fact that he is only able to connect with people on a cosmetic basis. He sees them on the apps, swipes because he's attracted to them. And when they swipe back, a conversaation ensues via text message.

Joe likes this approach, overall, but he finds that when he meets the people in person, they tend to not look like their pictures, or they're not who they made themselves out to be during the text exchange. 

This why we created DateIRL. The text message abrrier is broken down and we bring people together in a communal environment. People can be free to be themselves so that if their is a spark among singles, they can connect more naturally. Rather than wade through the potentials on an app.

## What We Built

The website is primarily an information portal for people who want to take part in a dating activity where they can connect with like-minded individuals with a view to finding a potential future partner.

The website consists of 4 pages which tell the user:

1. What we do and how it works
2. About us
3. A list of upcoming events
4. And a signup page to register interest

In the future, it is envisioned that the signup page will lead to a checkout, where users can actually reserve a spot, but for now, the information portal will suffice for the website's needs. Below are the initial wireframe models of the homepage on phone, tablet and desktop devices.

It should be noted that the above is a base. The colour scheme and font are not cemented. These will be clarified later in the project.

### Project re-direct

Having met with mentor Ronan on Saturday 19/2, we determined that the website was currently looking very 90s Geocities style. There has been a change in the direction of the website. Now the project is taking a 2 page approach with 3 sections in the homepage

Below are some screenshots of the renderfed site in a locally developed version of VS Code.

The decision was taken to develop the site locally instead of in GitPod to prevent too many commits while the new site was being developed. Code will be copied over from local environment to GitPod. Will then run tests to confirm file paths are relevant and media queries remain as developed locally.
